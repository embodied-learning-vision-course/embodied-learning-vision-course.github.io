## About

How do we build end-to-end learning agents for embodied AI? This graduate level course covers advanced topics in embodied visual learning, perception and planning, with applications to robotics and self-driving. Topics include deep learning, computer vision, 3D perception, unsupervised 3D learning, self-supervised representation learning, continual learning, foundation model agents, etc. The goals of the course are:
- Understand and apply computer vision and deep learning in the context of embodied agent learning by applying spatial geometric priors, model inductive biases, design multi-task network architectures, and embodied foundation models.
- Learn to formulate a variety of computer vision and robotics problems using deep learning tools.
- Develop a deep understanding of supervised and self-supervised representation learning for downstream perception and planning tasks.
- Develop hands-on skill of implementing embodied learning systems in simulator environments.

## Recommended Prerequisites
- Machine Learning (DS-GA 1003 or CSCI-GA 2565)
- Computer Vision (CSCI-GA 2271)
- Deep Learning (DS-GA 1008)
- Proficiency in Python Programming

## Logistics
- Lectures: Tuesday 2:45pm - 5:45pm (including 1hr recitation) 
- Location 12 Waverly Pl Room L120
- Office Hours: See [Staff](/staff) page.
- Communication: We will use Campuswire as our main communication tool for announcements and answering questions related to the lectures, assignments, and projects. The registration link is available on Brightspace.

## Grading
- **In-Class Participation (10%):** Marks will be given on the amount of in-class participation during the discussion and Q&A period.
- **Paper Review (15%):** Students need to submit a paper review on one of the selected readings every week.
- **Topic Presentation (30%):** Marks will be given on the prepared content, depth, analysis, and presentation quality.
- **Project (45%):**
	- **Project Proposal (10%):** Project proposal is due in the 6th week. Student groups will need to schedule a mandatory office hour to discuss the project with the instructor.
	- **Project Meetings (10%):** Each team is required to meet with their mentor every two weeks. To get full marks, team members need to show reasonable progress.
	- **Presentation (10%):** Project presentations are conducted in the final two weeks.
	- **Report (15%):** Project report is due in the final week.
